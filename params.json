For example, ASSERT_LT(foo(), bar()) means that foo() should be less than bar(). If the assert fails, \"pat\" will show the value of foo() and bar() to let programmer know more details about this fail.\r\nSecond, \"pat\" has enhanced the ability to integrate with the other projects via providing m4 scripts. User can use these scripts to integrate \"pat\" into their project as test and performance analysis framework.\r\nFinally, \"pat\" has added a building script to help user build \"pat\" by autotool more easier. User can execute the building script to build \"pat\" without setting configure file.\r\nEnjoy. \r\n\r\n### Support Platforms\r\nPat is verified on these platforms:\r\n* Mac OS X 10.9.2\r\n* Fedora 20\r\n* Ubuntu 13.10 \r\n","google":"UA-50267307-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
