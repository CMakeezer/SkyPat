This paper introduces "pat", a C++ performance analysis toolkit on Linux.
"pat" combines perf_events and unit tests together and gives programmers the power of fine-grained performance analysis via writing typical test cases.

"pat" integrates precise timer, symbol tables, and call-graph. 
User only has to write a unit test for their program by "pat". 
"pat" analyzes running time of each process of the program without effect from scheduler. 
"pat" also provides call-graph analysis to help user to find out the bottleneck of their program. 
Besides, we also provide visualize environment to provide more friendly interface.

Additional, "pat" can use assertion to check the correctness of unit test. 
User can set several fatal or non-fatal conditions.
When executing, the test will stop if it faces fatal failure.
After executing, the result can display on screen to help user varify conditions.

With the help of "pat", we hope people can analyze their program more easiler.
We have open source "pat" under the new BSD license. 
We hope we can have a chance to introduce "pat" on Linux Symposium.
