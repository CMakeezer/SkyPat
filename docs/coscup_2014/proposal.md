We want to introduce "pat", a C++ performance analysis toolkit on Linux.
"pat" combines perf_events and unit tests together and gives programmers the power of white-box performance analysis via writing typical test cases.

By using "pat", users can get running time of each region of the program without effect from scheduler and correctness of their program.

"pat" has opened source under the new BSD license. 
"pat" has also been accepted by "bold" project as its performance analysis tool.
We hope we could have a chance to introduce "pat" on COSCUP.
